 <h2>What It Is</h2>
  <p>We believe that pets, especially those raised in homes, shouldn't be left on the streets. 
    The <i>No Pet Left Behind</i> Project is our way of reducing that. We offer a free service where people can drop off their pets, which prevents them from being abandoned on the streets. 
    We put the pets in shelters, where they can be spayed/neutered, taken care of, then adopted out. 
  </p>

  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p>Here are some stats:
    <br> •  Around 3.9 million dogs are abandoned or given up to shelters each year.
    <br> •  3.2 million cats find themselves in a shelter every year - either born in a shelter, surrendered or abandoned.
    <br> If we can lower the statistics of pets being abandoned, and we bring more awareness to animals in shelter, then we can lower the number of pets without families, and raise the amount of happy pets and their people.

  <h2>What It Means For You</h2>
  <p>It is completely free to drop off pets. No cost. No judgement. Only a few basic questions about the pet themselves. 
    <br>If you feel unable to provide for your pet, fill out the form below. Don't feel backed into a corner. Situations change, and we think there should be options.
