 <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Our mission is to connect as many animals friends with as many loving families as possible.
    <br>We partner with community partners, animal shelters, and people like <i>you</i>, to help pets find their forever homes.</p>  
  <h2>Our Founding</h2>
  <p>Fur-Ever Friends was created and designed by Tessa Heimberger so that all people would have a chance to choose a pet for their family, and that all animals would have a chance to live in a loving home. 
   "I love my cat Olivia, she is one of my best friends." says Tessa, "And I think all pets deserve loving homes."
