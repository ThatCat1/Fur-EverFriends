    <label style=font-family:perpetua;font-size:115%;margin:15px;>We don't just partner with shelters, but with all sorts of animal organizations for volunteering opportunities. 
      <br>Some of those partnerships include animal conservations, state parks, local shelters, and humane societies. 
      <br> Please Note: All those who volunteering under the age of 15 must be accompanied by an adult. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Programs:</strong> 
      <br> Family Fun - A program for the family! We invite families to come help at adoption events. Great for teaching kids resposibility and a respect for animals!
      <br>
      <br> Volunteens - A program for teenagers (15-18). We love having teens help out at shelters and events. We believe this teaches them the importance of community service and taking care of animals. 
      <br>
      <br> Volunteers - A program for anyone. We invite anyone to help, regardless of age or experience. It is a great experience to make friends, find community, and learn from profesionals. 
      <br>
      <br> Senior + Pets - A program for seniors (60+). We love having our senoirs get involved in the community, especially with adoption events. A great opportunity for those who want to get around, spend time with animals, and make friends.
